# artificial-intelligence

## What is this repo about ?
This repository contains a script that uses a deep learning model created with keras and tensorflow.
this is for beginners that want to test simple deep learning models.


## How to use this code ?
- First clone or downmoad this repository on your computer

- After make sure that you have all required libraries installed on your computer like tensorflow and cv2.
You can use all tensorflow versions up to v1.15 but i recommende tensorflow v2.xx.
You can install theses with pip ($pip install --uprade tensorflow, cv2.....)

- Then replace the image path in the phyton script with the image you want to classify and just run the code (:
this is a very simple model so i recommend you to test with black white images. 

## I will sooner upload the script i used to create and train this simple model.
